    "        As a graduate in economics, I wanted to undertake a project related to this field. \n",
    "        Therefore, I decided to conduct an analysis related to international trade. Moreover,\n",
    "        I aim to analyze the impact of this on the economies of emerging countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Objective: To analyze the effect of variables closely related to international trade and examine their impact on the GDP. For my project, I have decided to divide everything into specific regions to facilitate the task and not to do it by country due to the time constraints I have to complete the project\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ## Variables definition\n",
    "        GDP (US$ in millions) : Gross domestic product. The total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific time period. \n",

    "\n",
    "        Trade Balance: The difference between the value of a country’s exports and imports for a given period. So basically, trade balance equals to Exports – Imports. If trade balance > 0 = surplus, trade balance < 0 = deficit. \n",
    "\n",
    "        Inflation (%): An increase of prices of goods and service over time, causing a reduction in the value of money. \n",

    "        Each regions's GDP increased but the Western Hemisphere and Sub-Saharan Afica showed occasional dips. The western Hemisphere seems to be constantly in a deficit situation due to Imports > Exports for all the year. \n",
    "        The Inflation rate is more varied among regions. Some regions, like Asia, show a marked increase in inflation in the latter years. Middle and Central Asia, exhibit significant volatility, suggesting instability in consumer prices. \n",

    "        I implemented the LinearRegression() model from sklearn in a log-log framework. \n",
    "        This log-log approach was chosen for several key reasons. \n",
    "        It transforms proportional relationships into linear ones, which makes the interpretation of regression coefficients simpler. Additionally, this method is particularly effective for modeling economic relationships, where many variables such as GDP, exports, and imports often follow log-normal distributions.\n",
    "        By using this approach, I was able to achieve more accurate and robust results compared to a standard linear model, providing more concrete and meaningful insights into the impact of these economic variables on GDP.\n",

    "        \n",
    "        ### Exports\n",
    "         \n",
    "         Globally, exports consistently show a positive impact on GDP across all regions.\n",
    "         The increase in GDP ranges broadly but remains significant, suggesting that higher export levels are generally beneficial for economic growth.\n",
    "         Regions like Asia and Europe exhibit particularly strong positive relationships between exports and GDP.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ### Imports\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Imports also demonstrate a positive correlation with GDP in most regions.\n",
    "        This positive effect varies across regions, indicating that imports can stimulate economic growth, possibly due to the import of essential goods and capital.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ### Inflation\n",
    "        \n",
    "        The impact of inflation on GDP is mixed and generally smaller compared to exports and imports.\n",
    "        Some regions exhibit a slight negative impact of inflation on GDP, while in others, the effect is slightly positive or inconsistent.\n",
    "        This variation suggests that the economic context and monetary policies of each region play a significant role in determining how inflation affects GDP.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ### The Openess Problem \n",
    "        \n",
    "        The negative impact of openness on GDP could be viewed as a counterintuitive interpretation. \n",
    "        However, to have a more detailed explanation, it is necessary to take into account that a country more open to the international economy does not necessarily mean that it will become richer. \n",
    "        In my study, the reason for the negative effect of the degree of openness can be explained in several ways. \n",
    "        For example, if the trade balance is negative (more imports than exports), this can possibly affect the GDP negatively.\n",
    "        Moreover, greater openness means more competition for local businesses, so they can lose market share, which reduces local production and employment. This can also be explained by the economic policies of countries; loss of control of resources to foreigners, etc.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ### R-Squared Values\n",
    "        \n",
    "        High R-squared values  and low mean squared errors across most models suggest a good fit, indicating that the models capture a significant portion of the variability in GDP.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        ## Conclusion\n",
    "        This analysis of international trade's impact on GDP in various regions highlights key findings. \n",
    "        Exports consistently boost GDP across regions, confirming their vital role in economic growth.\n",
    "        While imports generally show a positive influence, the negative relationship between trade openness and GDP growth is notable, suggesting complexities in global trade dynamics. \n",
    "        These insights underscore the need for region-specific trade policies and strategies, especially in emerging economies. The study offers a broad perspective on trade and economic development, emphasizing the importance of nuanced and informed economic policymaking.\n",
